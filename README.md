**Resale Flat Price Prediction in Singapore**

**Overview**

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the resale prices of flats in Singapore. The model will be deployed as a user-friendly web application, allowing users to estimate the resale value of flats based on historical transaction data and various flat features. This tool is designed to assist both potential buyers and sellers in making informed decisions in the competitive Singapore housing market.

**Motivation**

Accurately estimating the resale value of flats in Singapore can be challenging due to the many factors influencing prices, such as location, flat type, floor area, and lease duration. This project aims to create a predictive model that simplifies this task, providing reliable price estimates and aiding in better decision-making.

**Scope**

**The project encompasses the following tasks:**

**Data Collection and Preprocessing:** Gather historical resale flat transaction data from the Singapore Housing and Development Board (HDB) for the years 1990 to the present. Clean and structure the data for machine learning.

**Feature Engineering:** Extract relevant features from the dataset, including town, flat type, storey range, floor area, flat model, and lease commence date. Create additional features to enhance prediction accuracy.

**Model Selection and Training:** Choose an appropriate machine learning model for regression (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forests). Train the model using a portion of the dataset.

**Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance using regression metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R2 Score.

**Web Application Development:** Develop a user-friendly web application using Streamlit that allows users to input flat details and receive price predictions.

**Deployment:** Deploy the Streamlit application on the Render platform or any other cloud platform, making it accessible to users over the internet.

**Testing and Validation:** Thoroughly test the deployed application to ensure functionality and accuracy.

**Deliverables**
* A well-trained machine learning model for resale price prediction.
* A user-friendly web application built with Streamlit.
* Deployment of the application on the Render platform or any cloud platform.
* Documentation and instructions for using the application.
* A project report summarizing data analysis, model development, and deployment processes.
